# How long a step execution can be in "executing" state before being
# considered stuck. This typically happens when a worker process crashes
# mid-execution. The HousekeepingJob will recover these based on the
# stuck_recovery_action setting.

# GenevaDrive.stuck_in_progress_threshold = 1.hour

# How long a step execution can be past its scheduled_for time while
# still in "scheduled" state before being considered stuck. This can
# happen if jobs fail to enqueue or are lost by the queue backend.

# Whether to defer job enqueueing until after the database transaction commits.
# In production this ensures step execution records are visible to job workers
# before the job runs. In test environments (the default when Rails.env.test?)
# this is set to false so that jobs are enqueued immediately — transactional
# tests (especially with SQLite) never commit the outermost transaction, which
# can cause after_commit callbacks to misbehave or not fire at all.
#
# Set to true in tests if you need strict transaction semantics for a specific
# test suite, or if you are not using transactional tests.
